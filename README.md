# Programming Katas for Clojure

These Katas are supposed to be done many times like you would learn craftsmanship, the Software Craftsmanship.
Use TDD, test driven development, to invent your solution to the problem:

1. Write the test first, it should be **red**.
2. Implement the requirement to make the test at hand **green**.
   But do not implement more than the current test requires.
3. **Refactor** your code while the test stays green
