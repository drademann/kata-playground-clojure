# Hello Kata

A simple Kata to start with. While it might not give much to do for TDD,
it ensures that the system can test and run Clojure.

__Remember__:

- Do TDD.
- Do one requirement at a time, do not read ahead.
- Test first, there is no try.

## Task

Implement the following function:

    (greet)

It returns the text “Hello, World”.
Within a REPL, print the greeting.
